	<h2>
	This is my favorite movie because I have very fond memories of watching it. I haven't 
	watched it in a few years, but when I did watch it, I thought that the humor was relatable.
	All the voice actors did a good job with their roles, but Will Ferrell did a great job portraying
	an alien character.
