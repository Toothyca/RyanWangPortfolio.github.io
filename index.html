		<h2>Welcome.<h2>
		<p>Hi. Welcome to the website. Here, you'll find a compilation of all of the projects that I have completed over the course of the class. There are assignments done in Scratch, Java, Python, and 
		HTML[this website]. I've actually taken quite a few programming classes, but I haven't learned many useful languages[hence why I'm taking this class]. I don't think that you really care about what 
		I like but here it is anyways:</p>
		
		<h3>Sports</h3>
		<p>I've been playing tennis for about 7 years. I don't think that my skill is proportional to the amount of time that I've played. I over the years, I've only put in half of my time into it. I would
		I would play 2 or 3 times a week while all the other competitive boys would play 4+ days. I'm trying to put in more effort, but I think that I also might be taking it a bit too seriously. Whenever I'm
		playing badly, I get self-critical and kind of self destruct. I'm trying to develop a more positive personality but what it really boils down to is if I"m playing well or not. If I'm doing well and I
		mess up, I can brush it off. If I'm playing like garbage and I make a mistake, I find it hard not to scold myself. I'm hoping to improve enough in time for the tennis team tryouts and redeem myself.</p>
		
		<h3>Games</h3>
		<p>Whenever there's free time, I usually spend it playing video games. Currently, the two main games that I play are Overwatch and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's ironic because I spend a large amount
		of time playing yet I'm still pretty trash. I see it as a pastime yet I sometimes I get angry when my team gets crushed. Oddly enough though, if I'm playing badly, I know how to play in such a way to put 
		me in a place to succeed. I'm trying to figure out why I can do it in a game but not in tennis. I think that it has to do with nerves, but I'm not sure.</p>
		
		<h3>Academic Garbage</h3>
		<p>I don't think that I'm doing enough extra-curricular studies based on the types of classes that I'm taking. I also think that I'm not doing as well as I should be in classes based on the amount of extra-curricular
		studies that I'm doing. I'm taking only 2 'academic' classes and while everything is a solid A or above, I think that I'm not putting enough effort in. I'm spending too much time playing video games or procrastinating
		when I should be studying. Especially for AP World History, I think my study methods are short term only. I don't think that I'll remember much when AP testing rolls around. Also, I need to get my sleep or morning
		schedule together because so far, I've already been tardy 3 times.</p>
