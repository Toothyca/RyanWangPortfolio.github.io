		<a href ="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/119675806/"> <h2>Name Project</h2> </a>
		<p>The purpose of the project was to create sprites and scripts that would animate
		letters to display my name. There would need to be at least 3 unique behaviors for 
		each of the letters, and extra credit was provided for those who were able to have 
		the scene reset when the green flag was clicked. I decided to have the letters start
		at different parts of the screen, then come together at the center in the spotlight. 
		The letters would then be animated to switch between my first and last name. They would 
		also gradually change color. Even though it was unneeded, I added the ball for the because I felt like it. </p>
		
		<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
		<ul>
		<h2>
			<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked, when key pressed, the scene reset and played out</li>
			<li>Conditional statements - used if statements to determine whether or not the green flag had been clicked yet.</li>
			<li>Used loops -I used a forever block to repeat the animations forever until the animation was manually stopped for the green flag was clicked again.</li>
			<li>Sprites - I reused the sprites from the library for the background and letters, and ball.</li>
			<li>Movement - I added the go to x, y after the green flag block in order to reset the locations of the blocks. I then used the glide to x, y to animate the movement of the letters towards the center of the screen. I had the ball move an x amount of steps, then turn x degrees infinitely.</li>
		</h2>
		</ul>
		
		<a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120218686/"> <h2>Computer Buying Project</h2> </a>
		<p>The guidelines for the project were that it needed to be some kind of presentation displaying the specs of certain computers,
		then select one to be bought for certain criteria. I collaborated with Claude Yan on this, and interviewed our friend Derek for the criteria. 
		We made an animation in which Derek is at a computer store browsing for computers, and a salesman comes up to him and offers him a selection of four computers. 
		We had Derek select the computer that was most 'bang for your buck'. We got extra credit for the project because we implemented voice lines for the characters.</p>
		
		<h3> Concepts Learned</h3>
		<ul>
		<h2>
			<li>Broadcast - When a certain message was broadcasted, the sprites would respond. This is a better than just timing because it is less tedious, and when the green flag is clicked, you can set it to start at a certain scene.</li>
			<li>Sound - Used sound to make the project more interesting and entertaining. Also it was something that Claude could do in the meantime while I focused on the animation.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/121054091/"> <h2>Final Project</h2> </a>
		<p>The project was to be a game or an animation that covered all the concepts learned so far. 
		It needed to let the player know if they win, have a score and time counter, help screen, and level progression. 
		I decided to make a 'bullet hell' game, with multiple enemies spawning and shooting out projectiles. 
		After a certain amount of enemies spawned, a boss would appear, but I think I made the game too hard for anyone to actually reach it.</p>
		
		<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
		<ul>
		<h2>
			<li>Cloning - To make the multiple enemies, I needed to find a way to make clones of them from a spawner. Those clones would then make clones of the bullets.</li>
			<li>Go to - I needed to find a way to have the player’s ship move to the cursor, but not instantly. I had the sprite check if it was far enough from the cursor, then point and move towards it</li>
			<li>Touching - Having the sprite check if it is touching a certain object is the prime way to implement hit registry. Whenever the bullet touched the player/enemy or edge, it would trigger and disappear.  </li>
