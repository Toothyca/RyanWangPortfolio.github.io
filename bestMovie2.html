		<h2>Why I like the movie<h2>
		<p>	This is my favorite movie because I have very fond memories of watching the original
		series. When I found that there was a remake, I was very excited to see it. Out of the 
		remakes so far, this one is my favorite because it has more action than the first movie,
		and is more faithful to the originals and is less confusing than the third. The movie has
		excellent action and has better animation than the original series, but the movie also focuses 
		a lot on character development and how they interact with each other. The characters relatable 
		and the movie makes you care about them. The soundtrack is also great; the ochestra and choir 
		vocals mesh well with the action on screen.</p>
		<h2>Favorite Actor<h2>
		<p>Just because this movie is my favorite doesn't mean that I have a favorite actor within
		the movie. All the voice actors did an exceptional job portraying their characters and 
		emotions. If there were a character within the movie that I relate the most with, it would
		be Shinji. He is doing things to for others and rarely does things for himself. I think that
		I focus too much on what others think about me and am constantly doing things to please others 
		and forge better social relationships.</p>
